This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

source("load_pses_2020.R")

demq_map <- read.csv(
  file.path(data_dir,"pses_2020_dem_questions.csv"), 
  encoding = "UTF-8"
)

```


```{r}
dem_distribution <- pses_2020 %>%
  filter(level1id == 14) %>% 
  drop_na(anscount) %>% 
  left_join(demq_map) %>% 
  group_by(bycond) %>% 
  filter(anscount == max(anscount, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  distinct(dem_question, bycond, descrip_e, anscount) %>% 
  group_by(dem_question) %>% 
  mutate(
    prop = anscount / sum(anscount),
    percent = scales::percent(prop, accuracy = 0.1)
  ) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  arrange(dem_question, bycond)
  
```

```{r}

edi_qs <- c("Q40","Q55", "Q60", "Q61", "Q62", "Q67", "Q68", "Q69")
edi_demqs <- c("Q115","Q116","Q118","Q120","Q121A", "none")

edi_df <- pses_2020 %>% 
  filter(
    question %in% edi_qs, 
    dem_question %in% edi_demqs, 
    level1id == 14, 
    surveyr == 2020
  ) %>% 
  select(
    surveyr,
    dem_question,
    descrip_e,
    question,
    title_e,
    positive,
    neutral,
    negative,
    agree,

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
